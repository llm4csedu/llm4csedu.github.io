## Abstract
This article explores the natural language generation capabilities of large
language models with application to the production of two types of learning
resources common in programming courses. Using OpenAI Codex as the large
language model, we create programming exercises (including sample solutions and
test cases) and code explanations, assessing these qualitatively and
quantitatively. Our results suggest that the majority of the automatically
generated content is both novel and sensible, and in some cases ready to use as
is. When creating exercises we find that it is remarkably easy to influence
both the programming concepts and the contextual themes they contain, simply by
supplying keywords as input to the model. Our analysis suggests that there is
significant value in massive generative machine learning models as a tool for
instructors, although there remains a need for some oversight to ensure the
quality of the generated content before it is delivered to students. We further
discuss the implications of OpenAI Codex and similar tools for introductory
programming education and highlight future research streams that have the
potential to improve the quality of the educational experience for both
teachers and students alike.
