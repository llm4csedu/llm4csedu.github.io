## Abstract
ChatGPT, an implementation and application of large language models, has
gained significant popularity since its initial release. Researchers have been
exploring ways to harness the practical benefits of ChatGPT in real-world
scenarios. Educational researchers have investigated its potential in various
subjects, e.g., programming, mathematics, finance, clinical decision support,
etc. However, there has been limited attention given to its application in data
science education. This paper aims to bridge that gap by utilizing ChatGPT in a
data science course, gathering perspectives from students, and presenting our
experiences and feedback on using ChatGPT for teaching and learning in data
science education. The findings not only distinguish data science education
from other disciplines but also uncover new opportunities and challenges
associated with incorporating ChatGPT into the data science curriculum.
