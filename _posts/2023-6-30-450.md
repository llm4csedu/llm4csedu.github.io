## Abstract
Recent studies show that AI-driven code generation tools, such as Large Language Models, are able to solve most of the problems usually presented in introductory programming classes. However, it is still unknown how they cope with Object Oriented Programming assignments, where the students are asked to design and implement several interrelated classes (either by composition or inheritance) that follow a set of best-practices. Since the majority of the exercises in these tools' training dataset are written in English, it is also unclear how well they function with exercises published in other languages.In this paper, we report our experience using GPT-3 to solve 6 real-world tasks used in an Object Oriented Programming course at a Portuguese University and written in Portuguese. Our observations, based on an objective evaluation of the code, performed by an open-source Automatic Assessment Tool, show that GPT-3 is able to interpret and handle direct functional requirements, however it tends not to give the best solution in terms of object oriented design. We perform a qualitative analysis of GPT-3's output, and gather a set of recommendations for computer science educators, since we expect students to use and abuse this tool in their academic work.
