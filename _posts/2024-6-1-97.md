AbstractView references

As digital education transcends traditional boundaries, e-learning experiences are increasingly shaped by cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR), and adaptive learning systems. This study examines the integration of AI-driven personalized instruction within immersive VR environments, targeting enhanced learner engagement-a core metric in online education effectiveness. Employing a user-centric design, the research utilizes embodied AI tutors, calibrated to individual learners’ emotional intelligence and cognitive states, within a Python programming curriculum-a key area in computer science education. The methodology relies on intelligent tutoring systems and personalized learning pathways, catering to a diverse participant pool from Virginia Tech. Our data-driven approach, underpinned by the principles of educational psychology and computational pedagogy, indicates that AI-enhanced virtual learning environments significantly elevate user engagement and proficiency in programming education. Although the scope is limited to a single academic institution, the promising results advocate for the scalability of such AI-powered educational tools, with potential implications for distance learning, MOOCs, and lifelong learning platforms. This research contributes to the evolving narrative of smart education and the role of large language models (LLMs) in crafting bespoke educational experiences, suggesting a paradigm shift towards more interactive, personalized e-learning solutions that align with global educational technology trends. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.
