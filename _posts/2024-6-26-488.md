## Abstract
The traditional model of assigning textbook problems for homework is endangered by the ability of students to find answers to almost any published problem on the web. An alternative is a dual-submission approach, where students submit their work, then receive the solutions, and submit a second metacognitive reflection, explaining any errors they made. Students’ scores can depend on the quality of their second submissions alone or the combined quality of their first and second submissions. We tried this approach in a class on parallel computer architecture. We report students’ personal experience based on their questionnaires responses. In addition, we quantitatively compare students’ performance on test questions related to dual-submission homework against their performance on other questions and previous semesters’ student performance on similar questions. Students overwhelmingly preferred this approach and thought they learned more from it, but evidence about whether it improved their learning was inconclusive. We also analyze the continued viability of this approach in the era of large language models.
