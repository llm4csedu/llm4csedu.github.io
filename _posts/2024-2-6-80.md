AbstractView references

The emergence of Large Language Models and their deployment in systems such as ChatGPT are poised to have a major impact on STEM education, particularly Computer Science. These generative large language models can produce program code as well as human language output. This has potentially serious implications for computer science programs and pedagogy. This work provides a qualitative assessment sample code generated by ChatGPT, as an example of an LLM explores implications for computing pedagogy.... © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.
