  and Bard's Capacity to Handle Object-Oriented Programming Assignments"

## Abstract
Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools to assist
students while solving programming assignments. However, object-oriented
programming (OOP), with its inherent complexity involving the identification of
entities, relationships, and responsibilities, is not yet mastered by these
tools. Contrary to introductory programming exercises, there exists a research
gap with regard to the behavior of LLMs in OOP contexts. In this study, we
experimented with three prominent LLMs - GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Bard - to solve
real-world OOP exercises used in educational settings, subsequently validating
their solutions using an Automatic Assessment Tool (AAT). The findings revealed
that while the models frequently achieved mostly working solutions to the
exercises, they often overlooked the best practices of OOP. GPT-4 stood out as
the most proficient, followed by GPT-3.5, with Bard trailing last. We advocate
for a renewed emphasis on code quality when employing these models and explore
the potential of pairing LLMs with AATs in pedagogical settings. In conclusion,
while GPT-4 showcases promise, the deployment of these models in OOP education
still mandates supervision.
