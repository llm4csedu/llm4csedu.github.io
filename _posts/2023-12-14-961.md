## Abstract
Timely formative feedback is considered as one of the most important drivers
for effective learning. Delivering timely and individualized feedback is
particularly challenging in large classes in higher education. Recently Large
Language Models such as GPT-3 became available to the public that showed
promising results on various tasks such as code generation and code
explanation. This paper investigates the potential of AI in providing
personalized code correction and generating feedback. Based on existing student
submissions of two different real-world assignments, the correctness of the
AI-aided e-assessment as well as the characteristics such as fault
localization, correctness of hints, and code style suggestions of the generated
feedback are investigated. The results show that 73 % of the submissions were
correctly identified as either correct or incorrect. In 59 % of these cases,
GPT-3.5 also successfully generated effective and high-quality feedback.
Additionally, GPT-3.5 exhibited weaknesses in its evaluation, including
localization of errors that were not the actual errors, or even hallucinated
errors. Implications and potential new usage scenarios are discussed.
